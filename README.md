# SecureAuth: MERN WebApp with JWT Authentication

## Overview
This documentation provides an overview of SecureAauth, a web application for login and registration developed using the MERN stack.

## Technologies Used
- **MERN Stack**: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Used for authentication and token-based authorization.
- **Bootstrap**: Utilized for CSS design and responsive layouts.
